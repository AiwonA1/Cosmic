PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
-----------------
Total analysis time (standard patterns): 914 seconds
Total analysis time (ping patterns): 38 seconds
Peak memory usage: ~2.1 GB

File I/O operations:
- 2 FITS files read
- 14 PNG images generated
- 5 JSON files written
- 3 TXT reports generated

NOTABLE FINDINGS
--------------
1. Standard pattern analysis identified 18 patterns across both detectors using
   three different approaches (CONTROL, FRACTAL, HYBRID).

2. Ping pattern analysis found 2,202 ping patterns, with a striking difference
   between detectors (1 in NRS1, 2,201 in NRS2).

3. Different approaches showed complementary strengths:
   - CONTROL: Higher confidence scores, better at detecting conventional sources
   - FRACTAL: Superior at detecting patterns with high symmetry and self-similarity
   - HYBRID: Successfully combined insights to identify complex patterns

4. NRS2 exhibits significantly more patterns overall than NRS1, both in standard
   pattern analysis (13 vs. 5) and especially in ping pattern analysis (2,201 vs. 1).
