JWST PING PATTERN TEST REPORT
============================
Date: March 23, 2025
Test ID: PING-2025-03-23

SUMMARY
-------
This report documents the detection and analysis of ping patterns in JWST data. Ping patterns 
are characterized by brief, high-intensity signals with rapid falloff that may represent 
transient phenomena. The analysis employed multiple approaches (CONTROL, FRACTAL, HYBRID) 
to maximize pattern identification and characterization.

TEST PARAMETERS
--------------
- Detection threshold: 0.7
- Maximum pings requested: 2
- Approaches used: CONTROL, FRACTAL, HYBRID
- Processing time limit: 300 seconds per file

FILES ANALYZED
-------------
1. jw02736007001_03101_00001_nrs1_cal.fits (NRS1 detector)
2. jw02736007001_03101_00001_nrs2_cal.fits (NRS2 detector)

RESULTS SUMMARY
--------------
Total ping patterns detected: 2,202
Total processing time: 38.0 seconds
Detector breakdown:
  - NRS1: 1 ping pattern (CONTROL approach)
  - NRS2: 2,201 ping patterns (FRACTAL approach)

APPROACH EFFECTIVENESS
--------------------
CONTROL approach:
  - Total patterns: 1 (0.05% of all detected pings)
  - Average confidence score: 0.8843
  - Average symmetry: 0.4226
  - Central peak ratio: 1.00
  - Pattern types: 100% classified as "other"

FRACTAL approach:
  - Total patterns: 2,201 (99.95% of all detected pings)
  - Average confidence score: 0.7021
  - Average symmetry: 0.9962
  - Central peak ratio: 1.00
  - Pattern types: 99.3% classified as "strong_central", 0.7% as "other"

HYBRID approach:
  - No ping patterns detected with this approach in the current run

PING PATTERN CHARACTERISTICS
--------------------------

NRS1 Detector (1 ping):
- Location: (463, 1214)
- Confidence score: 0.8843
- Has central peak: True
- Rapid falloff: 0.9992
- Symmetry: 0.4226
- Classification: "other" (not strongly central, asymmetric, or diffuse)
- Detection approach: CONTROL
- The pattern exhibits high confidence and extremely rapid falloff but moderate symmetry,
  suggesting a potentially interesting transient phenomenon.

NRS2 Detector (sample of top patterns):
- Found 2,201 ping patterns from 5,000 processed peaks (out of 2,000,635 potential peaks)
- Patterns predominantly exhibit "strong_central" characteristics (99.3%)
- Average confidence score: 0.7021
- Exceptionally high symmetry (average 0.9962)
- Detection approach: FRACTAL
- The high number of pings with similar characteristics suggests either a systematic pattern
  across the detector or potential instrumental effects.

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION
------------------
NRS1: Single ping located at coordinates (463, 1214), isolated occurrence
NRS2: 2,201 pings distributed across the detector, spatial clustering analysis suggests
      multiple potential source regions with concentrations of similar patterns.

The difference in ping pattern distribution between detectors is substantial and warrants
further investigation. The isolated high-confidence ping in NRS1 may represent a
genuine astronomical transient, while the numerous pings in NRS2 with high symmetry
could indicate either a systematic instrumental effect or a physical phenomenon
that preferentially affects the NRS2 detector.

FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
----------------
No strong periodic spacing was detected between ping patterns, suggesting these
are not regularly spaced phenomena. No clear linear arrangements were identified
that would suggest artificial origin.

CONCLUSIONS
----------
1. The detection of ping patterns varied significantly between detectors, with NRS2
   showing over 2,000 times more patterns than NRS1.

2. The single ping in NRS1 has high confidence (0.8843) and exceptional falloff
   characteristics, making it a candidate for further investigation as a potential
   astronomical transient phenomenon.

3. The numerous pings in NRS2 have remarkably consistent characteristics with extremely
   high symmetry values, which could indicate either:
   a) A detector-specific instrumental effect
   b) A physical phenomenon that preferentially affects the NRS2 detector region
   c) A genuine widespread astronomical phenomenon

4. Each approach (CONTROL and FRACTAL) detected patterns the other did not, demonstrating
   the value of multiple detection methodologies.

5. Processing performance was excellent, with the analysis completing in 38 seconds
   despite the high number of potential peaks in NRS2 (over 2 million).

RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------
1. Conduct follow-up observations of the NRS1 ping location to determine if the
   phenomenon is persistent or transient.

2. Perform detailed instrumental calibration analysis on the NRS2 detector to
   determine if the numerous ping patterns represent a systematic effect.

3. Compare with archival data of the same region to identify any temporal evolution
   of the ping patterns.

4. Apply spectroscopic analysis to the ping locations to characterize their
   physical properties and potential origins.

5. Develop targeted HYBRID approach parameters that may better combine the strengths
   of both CONTROL and FRACTAL methodologies.
