JWST Ping Pattern Analysis Report
================================

Total ping patterns detected: 2202
Detectors analyzed: 2

Detection Approaches:
--------------------
CONTROL: 1 pings (0.0%)
FRACTAL: 2201 pings (100.0%)

Approach Comparison:
------------------

CONTROL approach (1 pings):
  Average confidence score: 0.8843 (std: 0.0000)
  Average symmetry: 0.4226 (std: 0.0000)
  Central peak ratio: 1.00
  CONTROL approach focuses on detection through traditional image processing and statistical thresholding,
  identifying significant intensity peaks against background noise.


FRACTAL approach (2201 pings):
  Average confidence score: 0.7021 (std: 0.0133)
  Average symmetry: 0.9958 (std: 0.0490)
  Central peak ratio: 1.00
  FRACTAL approach leverages multi-scale analysis to identify self-similar patterns
  and scale-invariant structures in the data.


Comparative observations:
- CONTROL approach had the highest average confidence scores (0.8843)
- CONTROL approach identified patterns with the strongest central peaks
- CONTROL approach exclusively detected 1 ping patterns not found by other approaches
- FRACTAL approach exclusively detected 1 ping patterns not found by other approaches
