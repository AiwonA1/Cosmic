   Interpretation: Shows the visual characteristics of several ping patterns detected
   by the FRACTAL approach, with confidence scores and positions labeled.
   
8. nrs1_CONTROL_pings.png
   Description: CONTROL approach ping patterns in NRS1
   Content: The single ping pattern detected by the CONTROL approach
   Interpretation: Shows the visual appearance of the ping detected using traditional
   image processing methods, which exhibits high confidence but moderate symmetry.
   
9. nrs2_FRACTAL_pings.png
   Description: FRACTAL approach ping patterns in NRS2
   Content: Sample of ping patterns detected by the FRACTAL approach
   Interpretation: Shows examples of the highly symmetric ping patterns that the
   FRACTAL approach was particularly effective at identifying.
   
10. nrs1_SCI_with_pings.png
    Description: NRS1 detector image with ping location marked
    Content: Full detector image with red 'X' marking the location of the detected ping
    Interpretation: Shows the context of where the single ping pattern was detected
    within the full NRS1 detector field.
    
11. nrs2_SCI_with_pings.png
    Description: NRS2 detector image with ping locations marked
    Content: Full detector image with red 'X' marks for detected pings
    Interpretation: Shows the spatial distribution of ping patterns across the NRS2
    detector, revealing any clustering or systematic arrangement.

APPROACH COMPARISON VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------

12. visualizations/ping_patterns_by_approach.png
    Description: Bar chart of ping patterns detected by each approach
    Content: Bar chart showing counts of patterns found by CONTROL, FRACTAL, and HYBRID
    Interpretation: Visually quantifies the effectiveness of each approach at identifying
    ping patterns, showing that FRACTAL detected the vast majority.
    
13. visualizations/ping_characteristics_radar.png
    Description: Radar chart comparing ping characteristics by approach
    Content: Multi-axis radar chart comparing metrics such as confidence, symmetry,
             falloff, and central peak across detection approaches
    Interpretation: Shows the relative strengths of each approach across different
    quality metrics, revealing that CONTROL achieves higher confidence while FRACTAL
    excels at identifying symmetric patterns.

HOW TO USE THESE VISUALIZATIONS
-----------------------------

1. Start with the general data visualizations (1-3) to understand the overall
   characteristics of the JWST data.
   
2. Review the standard pattern visualizations (4-5) to see the baseline detector images.

3. Examine the ping pattern visualizations (6-11) to see:
   - The visual appearance of individual ping patterns
   - How ping patterns are distributed across the detectors
   - Differences between patterns detected by different approaches
   
4. Study the approach comparison visualizations (12-13) to understand:
   - Which approaches were most effective at finding ping patterns
   - How ping characteristics vary between approaches
   
5. Cross-reference visualizations with the written reports:
   - comprehensive_pattern_test_report.txt
   - ping_pattern_test_report.txt
   - consolidated_analysis_log.txt
   
This multi-faceted approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of both the
data characteristics and the patterns identified through various analysis methods.
